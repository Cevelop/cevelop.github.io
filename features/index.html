      <h1>CUTE Plug-in with TDD support</h1>
      <p>
	<a href="http://cute-test.com/">CUTE</a>, short for C++ Unit Testing Easier, is a C++ unit testing framework mandatory for every C++ project. The CUTE plug-in support easy development and management of CUTE unit tests for your software. Features like red/green-bar result visualization, automatic test registration and code coverage aleviate every-day tasks of a software developer. The plug-in also encourages test driven development through various code generation mechanisms, reducing development time significantly.
      </p>
      <h1>Mockator</h1>
      <p>
	<a href="http://mockator.com/">Mockator</a> assists the software developer in creating mock objects and test doubles when writing regression tests. When working with legacy code it also supports the integration of several kinds of seams. Thereby, boilerplate and infrastructure code is automatically generated, which reduces accidental mistakes when writing such code by hand.
      </p>
      <h1>Namespactor</h1>
      <p>
	The Namespactor plug-in provides several useful namespace-related automated refactorings. It is capable to quality unqualified names and it can inline and extract using directives and declarations.
      </p>
      <h1>Macronator</h1>
      <p>
	Macros should not be used in modern C++ code. Their use often leads to semantic errors which get obfuscated in the macro definition. An IDE has a hard time to highlight compilation errors related to macros correctly. Usually macros can be replaced with more suitable C++ code. <a href="http://cute-test.com/projects/macronator/wiki">Macronator</a> helps a software developer to demacrofy C++ his code and make it more readable.
      </p>
      <h1>SConsolidator</h1>
      <p>
	SCons is a widespread used tool for configuring build. It offers automatic dependency extraction and has a much simpler syntax than make. With <a href="http://sconsolidator.com/">SConsolidator</a> Cevelop provides a tight integration of SCons for your C++ projects.
      </p>
      <h1>Elevator</h1>
      <p>
	Modern C++ software must be written in the latest version of the language standard. Elevator assists the programmer to spring-clean his code and make it C++11 compliant.
