title:  "Cevelop 1.12.0 Release"
---

Today, we released Cevelop 1.12.0. It is based on Eclipse CDT 9.8 and the underlying Eclipse 2019-06 Platform,
which brings many improvements. We also fixed some minor bugs and added the
Codeanalysator as a new Beta plug-in.

* Codeanalysator, that comes with many checkers for MISRA, Autosar and the C++ Core Guidelines.
* CUTE Headers have been updated to the latest version 2.2.3
* Bugfixes for the TDD, Constificator and other plug-ins
* Eclipse CDT CMake support is now also included in the IDE
* Added the different platform update sites to make it easier to install other plug-ins

As always, you can download Cevelop 1.12.0 from our [Download](/download) page. If you have any issues or other feedback, please [let us know](/contact).
