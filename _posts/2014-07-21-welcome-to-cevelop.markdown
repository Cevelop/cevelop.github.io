We are very excited to introduce **Cevelop**, our new IDE for <span style="color:red;">C++</span> developers based on CDT, the Eclipse <span style="color:red;">C/C++</span> Development Tools.

At the <a href="https://ifs.hsr.ch" target="_blank">Institute for Software</a> we have developed numerous plug-ins for Eclipse, like the popular <a href="http://www.cute-test.com" target="_blank">CUTE</a> unit testing framework. We have also contributed directly to CDT &ndash; the refactoring infrastructure was originally developed at IFS and then committed to CDT. Over the years, as the number of plug-ins kept growing, it has also become a bit confusing. So we wanted to make it easier for developers to use our plug-ins, that's why we've created Cevelop, a bundle of the latest and greatest Eclipse CDT release plus a host of our own plug-ins.

Our goal is to make it easier and more pleasurable to write modern <span style="color:red;">C++</span> code!
