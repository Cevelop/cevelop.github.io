We are very excited to introduce **Cevelop**, our new IDE for C++ developers based on CDT, the Eclipse C/C++ Development Tools.

At the [Institute for Software](http://ifs.hsr.ch) we have developed numerous plug-ins for Eclipse, like the popular [CUTE](http://www.cute-test.com) unit testing framework. We have also contributed directly to CDT &ndash; the refactoring infrastructure was originally developed at IFS and then committed to CDT. Over the years, as the number of plug-ins kept growing, it has also become a bit confusing. So we wanted to make it easier for developers to use our plug-ins, that's why we've created Cevelop, a bundle of the latest and greatest Eclipse CDT release plus a host of our own plug-ins.

Our goal is to make it easier and more pleasurable to write modern C++ code!
