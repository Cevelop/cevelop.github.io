title:  "Cevelop 1.5 for Neon"
---

Summer has finally arrived here in Switzerland, and with it the latest Eclipse 4.6 release, code-named Neon.
The most important changes of the Eclipse platform are summarized in [Platform New and Noteworthy](https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.6/platform.php), among the highlights is the HiDPI support
 on Windows and Linux (OSX has had it for some years). Thanks to improvements in Eclipse CDT, you can now [suppress code-analysis messages](https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/User/NewIn90#Code_Analysis).

This spring, we released a preview release of Cevelop with some exciting new plug-ins. We are happy to include them in this release:

* <a href="/features/#templator">Templator</a>: Visualization of arbitrarily nested template instantiations, overload resolutions, and specializations (see screenshot below).
* Constificator: Detection and constification of variable declarations in functions and classes.
* Const placement: Option to automatically align const qualifiers in variable declarations on the right-hand side or left-hand side of the type.
* CharWars: Automated refactoring of C-style strings into <code>std::string</code>-objects.

A special thanks to all the testers and bug reporters! There might still be problems and false positives in our code-analysis plug-ins (don't forget that you can now [suppress any messages](/faq/#suppression)). Please report them directly to our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/Cevelop/Issues).


Cevelop 1.5 can be downloaded from our <a href='/download/'>Download</a> page. If you have any issues or other feedback [let us know](/contact).
