title:  "Cevelop 1.10.0 Photon Release"
---

After the release of Eclipse **Photon** and Eclipse CDT 9.5.1, we are proud to announce the release of Cevelop 1.10.0.

Eclipse CDT 9.5.1 comes with several new features, some of them contributed by us:

* <span style="color:red;">C++</span>14: Lambda Init-Captures
* <span style="color:red;">C++</span>17: Nested Namespace Definitions, `static_assert` without Message, `constexpr if`, `if` with Initializer, `switch` with Initializer, `template <auto>`, `*this` in Lambda Captures

<br/>

All these changes are incorporated into the new Cevelop IDE!

You can find Cevelop ready for to be downloaded as usual on our [Download](/download) page. Please [contact us](/contact), if you should experience any issues.
