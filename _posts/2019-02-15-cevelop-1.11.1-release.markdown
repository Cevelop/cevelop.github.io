title:  "Cevelop 1.11.1 Release"
---

Today, we released Cevelop 1.11.1. This is the first 64-bit-only release since the underlying Eclipse Platform dropped 32-bit support.
The new Cevelop is based on Eclipse CDT 9.6 which comes with improved support for C++17 and C++ attributes. Additionally,
the following bugs have been fixed:

* Several quick-fixes have been missing in the last release
* Macro conversion for C++14 and above sometimes produced invalid code
* Several refactorings were missing from the menus
* "Extract using directive" triggered the wrong refactoring

<br/>

As always, you can download Cevelop 1.11.1 from our [Download](/download) page. If you have any issues or other feedback, please [let us know](/contact).
