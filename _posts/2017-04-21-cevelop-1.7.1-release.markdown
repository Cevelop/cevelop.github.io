title:  "Cevelop 1.7.1 Release"
---
Today, we released Cevelop 1.7.1. This is a minor bug-fix release that resolves the following issues:

* Fixes a bug that caused a crash of the Templator plug-in
* Fixes a bug that prevented the deinstallation of plug-ins
* Various bug fixes in the Includator plug-in

<br/>

In order to fix these bugs, we had to temporarily remove the const placement option from Cevelop.

As always, you can download Cevelop 1.7.1 from our [Download](/download) page. If you have any issues or other feedback, please [let us know](/contact).
