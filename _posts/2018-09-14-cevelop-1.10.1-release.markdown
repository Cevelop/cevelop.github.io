We are pleased to announce the release of Cevelop 1.10.1. This release features an improved
version of the Templator Plug-in which now supports variable templates and alias templates. The
new Cevelop is based on Eclipse CDT 9.5.2 which comes with improved indexer performance. Additionally,
the following bugs in the CUTE plug-in have been fixed:

* Fixes a null pointer exception that occurred when the CUTE headers were missing
* Fixes the test-suite templates for C++11 and above

<br/>

As always, you can download Cevelop 1.10.1 from our [Download](/download) page. If you have any issues or other feedback, please [let us know](/contact).
