It has just become even easier to get the latest version of our <span style="color:red;">C++</span> IDE, at least if you're on a Mac. As of today, Cevelop 1.4 is available via <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>.

To install it, open a terminal and type

<p><kbd>brew update</kbd><br/>
<kbd>brew cask install cevelop</kbd></p>

If this is the first time you are using <code>brew cask</code>, Homebrew might ask for your admin password. Should you have any issues with the installation procedure, [let us know](/contact).
