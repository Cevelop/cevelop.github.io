If you're on a Mac, it has just become even easier to get the latest version of our <span style="color:red;">C++</span> IDE. As of today, Cevelop 1.4 is available via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

To install it, open a terminal and type

<p><kbd>brew update</kbd><br/>
<kbd>brew cask install cevelop</kbd></p>

If this is the first type you use <code>cask</code>, Homebrew might ask for your password. Should you have any issues with the installation procedure, [let us know](/contact).
