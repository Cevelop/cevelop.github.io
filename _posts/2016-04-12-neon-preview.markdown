---
A preview of our upcoming Cevelop 1.5 based on the upcoming Eclipse CDT 9.0 (Neon) is now available for all major platforms. This preview introduces a set of new features that will make your C++ development experience even better:

* <a href="/features/#templator">Templator</a>: Visualization of (arbitrarily nested) template instantiations, selected overloads, and specializations (See screenshot below).
* Constificator: Detection and constification of variable declarations in functions and classes.
* Const placement: Option to automatically align const qualifiers in variable declarations on the right-hand side or left-hand side of the type.
* CharWars: Automated refactoring of C-style strings into <code>std::string</code>-objects.
