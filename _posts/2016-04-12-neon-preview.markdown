---
A preview of the next Cevelop release, which is based on the upcoming Eclipse CDT 9.0 (Neon), is now available for all supported platforms. This preview introduces a set of new features that will make your <span style="color:red;">C++</span> development experience even better:

* <a href="/features/#templator">Templator</a>: Visualization of (arbitrarily nested) template instantiations, overload resolutions, and specializations.
* <strong>Constificator</strong>: Detection and constification of variable declarations in functions and classes.
* Const placement: Option to automatically align const qualifiers in variable declarations on the right-hand side or left-hand side of the type.
* <strong>CharWars</strong>: Automated refactoring of C-style strings into <code>std::string</code>-objects.
