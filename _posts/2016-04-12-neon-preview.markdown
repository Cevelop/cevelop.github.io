A preview of the upcoming Cevelop 1.5.0 based on Eclipse CDT 9.0 (Neon) is now available for all major platforms. This preview introduces a set of new features that will make your C++ development experience even better:

* Templator: Visualization (arbitrarily nested) template instantiations, selected overloads, and specializations (See screenshot below).
* Constificator: Detection and constification of variable declarations in functions and classes.
* Const Placement: Option to automatically align const qualifiers in variable declarations on the right-hand side of the type.
