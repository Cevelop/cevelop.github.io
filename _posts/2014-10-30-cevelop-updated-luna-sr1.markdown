title:  "Cevelop Updated for the Eclipse Luna Service Release 1"
---

No trick, just a treat: we have rebased Cevelop on top of the latest Eclipse Luna Service Release SR1. The Eclipse CDT team used the chance to include some new features. For example, code completion can now show default arguments and gives you more information on template parameters:

See the [CDT 8.5 changelog](https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/User/NewIn85) for a comprehensive list of changes. Also included in this Cevelop release is the latest release of CUTE, where we fixed some bugs. Download [Cevelop 1.1.0](/download) and see for yourself. If you are already using Cevelop, you can also try to update your installation through <i>Help</i> &rarr; <i>Check for Updates</i>, but there are some problems with this approach. It can fail under Windows because the update tries to replace the active <code>cevelop.exe</code>, you can either [work around it](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22427728/eclipse-kepler-cant-install-updates) or just download a fresh copy. If you are running OS X, we also recommend downloading a fresh installation.
