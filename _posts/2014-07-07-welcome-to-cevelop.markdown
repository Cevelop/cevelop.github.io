Welcome to **Cevelop**, our new IDE for C++ developers.

New IDE? Let me explain: for years we at the [Institute for Software](http://ifs.hsr.ch) have been developing plug-ins for Eclipse's C/C++ Development Tools, like the popular [CUTE](http://www.cute-test.com) unit testing framework. We have also contributed directly to CDT &ndash; the refactoring infrastructure was originally developed at IFS and then committed to CDT. But we needed to make it easier for developers to use our plug-ins, that's why we've created Cevelop, a bundle of the latest and greatest Eclipse CDT release plus a host of our own plug-ins.

Get more information about the [team behind Cevelop](/about) and the [features it contains](/features). Or just [download](/download) Cevelop and see for yourself. You should also [follow us on Twitter](http://twitter.com/cevelop), and [let us know](/contact) what you think.
