      <h2>Cevelop does not start</h2>
      <p>This is usually caused by an outdated Java version. Cevelop requires Java 7 or 8 to run. Here are some links to get you started:</p>

      <h2>I have installed MinGW but Cevelop does not detect it</h2>
      <p>Cevelop is based on the Eclipse C/C++ Development Tools, which handles the detection of the toolchain. If you've installed MinGW and Cevelop doesn't find it, please <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/User/FAQ#I_installed_MinGW_toolchain_on_my_PC_but_Eclipse_won.27t_find_it">see the Eclipse FAQ</a>.</p>
