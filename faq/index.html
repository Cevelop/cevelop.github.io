      <h2>Cevelop does not start</h2>
      <p>This is usually caused by an outdated Java version. Cevelop requires Java 7 or 8 to run. Here are some links to get you started:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://oliverdowling.com.au/2015/10/09/oracles-jre-8-on-mac-os-x-el-capitan/">Installing Java 8 on OS X El Capitan</a></li>

      </ul>
      <h2>I have installed MinGW but Cevelop does not detect it</h2>
      <p>Cevelop is based on the Eclipse C/C++ Development Tools, which handles the detection of the toolchain. If you've installed MinGW and Cevelop doesn't find it, please <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/User/FAQ#I_installed_MinGW_toolchain_on_my_PC_but_Eclipse_won.27t_find_it">see the Eclipse FAQ</a>.</p>
      <h2>Cevelop cannot resolve my included headers</h2>
      <p>One of the trickiest tasks to get right when setting up a project in Cevelop is the include paths. <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2013/october/article4.php">This Eclipse newsletter discusses the several options and configuration dialogs.</a></p>
