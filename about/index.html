      <p>At the Institute for Sofware we have been developing plug-ins for Eclipse CDT for almost a decade. Some of this work has been contributed back to Eclipse (e.g. the majority of refactorings and the underlying infrastructure for writing refactorings), others like <a href="http://linticator.com">Linticator</a> are available commercially, but the majority is open source (e.g. <a href="marketplace.eclipse.org/content/metriculator">Metriculator</a>) or free to use (e.g. <a href="http://cute-test.com">CUTE</a>).</p>
      
      <p>Over time, as more and more plug-ins were created, it became tedious to discover and install them one by one. So we decided to bundle them all into one single <a href="/download">download</a>, including the latest release of Eclipse CDT.</p>
